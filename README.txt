This project explores sorting using vectors, map, lis, etc  in C++ with regards to how memory usage affects efficiency. 
Just run make within the respective directories to witness how long sorting took with specific implementation.


Vector
Contains make file, if you run make and then ./vector you should get the list and the number of seconds it took for deletion and insertion.

Map
Contains make file, if you run make and the ./map should get a list and the number of seconds for insertion and deletion.

List
contains make file, if you run make and then ./list should output a list and seconds for insertion and deletion.

Other
This is a second test using vector but with large struct Person object. If you run make and the ./other should show list and the seconds for insertion and deletion. 

Right now all implementations just choose numbers from 1-10. You can change this variable at the start of each file. For my tests, I ran with list sizes up 2000000 and after that I had to wait a while to get output. Code can be cleaner in terms of naming variables better.
